                               Group Analysis
=============================================================================

In this folder you find a very simple example of group file.
This file lists the name of each group (one per line), followed by
the list of users who belong to that group.
For example, the line:
 
  adm:x:4:corrado,davide,yves

means that the group "adm" contains three users ("corrado", "davide", "yves")
In this exercise, please ignore the second field (x) and the third one (4).

Your goal is to print the list of users, ordered by how many groups they
belong to. 
For example, for the file in this directory the output should be:

      3 davide
      3 corrado
      2 test
      1 yves
      1 test2
      1 omar
      1 nobody
      1 luke
      1 eigenvalue
      1 Xol
