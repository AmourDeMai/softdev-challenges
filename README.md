# softdev-challenges
My solutions for the challenges of software development course at Eurecom. This course is taught by 
[Davide Balzarotti](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/index.html), [Course link](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/softdev/).

##Course topics
###Linux command line
The goal of this part is to learn the Unix philosophy and be able to quickly solve simple problems combining together a bit of sed, awk, grep, sort, ...
###Python programming
When tasks get too complex to solve on a bash prompt.. it is time to switch to a more modern scripting language. In our case, Python.
###Sofdev tools and tool-chain
This part covers several topics, from versioning with Subversion and Git, to compiling with GCC and Makefiles, up to using the autotools chain to create portable projects.

##Challenges
During the course, we receive the credentials to login into a challenge machine, in which we have to solve a number of increasingly
difficult assignments. For each of them, they are required to develop and submit a piece of software (or a sequence of commands on 
the shell) to solve a given problem. All codes are tested automatically and every time a challenge is solved, the next one in the same 
category is unlocked.
<br/>I uploaded my solutions for all the challenges.

##By the end
Thanks to Mr Balzarotti, I reviewed my linux skills and learnt some new tools like sed and awk. Besides, this course led me to a new
world of python which is quitely efficient and convenient. It was a great pleasure to solve all the challenges.
