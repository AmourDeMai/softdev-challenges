       -----------====== CHALLENGE ======-----------

It's time to prove your ability to become a Python Master.
The objective is to solve a simple game: given a certain number
of tiles, you have to put them together in order to recompose
perfect square.

Write a python program that loads 7 files (containing the pieces
of the square) and print the recomposed square. For instance,
loading the files under '/pieces/':

AAA    BB
  A    BB              
G                     
G      D          
      DDD   E    
F           EE  
F      CC 
F     CC

your program has to print something like:

AAAGF
BBAGF
BBCCF
ECCDF
EEDDD

(check out the square.jpg picture for a more easy to understand
version)

Important:
* Each block can be used only once
* Each block can be placed wherever you want, but it cannot be rotated
* There may exists multiple solutions for a given problem. Just print one
* The program have to print only the solution, nothing else
* The program has around 20 seconds to complete the puzzle


       -----------====== SUBMISSION ======-----------

Submit your python program. It will be invoked like:

> python yourprogram A B C D E F G

The content of the files WILL be different from the example above!
