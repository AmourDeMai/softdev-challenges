  -----------====== The Challenge  ======--------------

There is a strange server running on port 9999
Please submit a python client that can talk to the server and solve
all its puzzles.


   -----------====== Submission  ======--------------

Submit a single python script that can talk to the server all the way
to the end of the "conversation". You need to provide your secret,
but please hardcode it in the solution as you cannot read it from
the file in your home directory.

As its last line, your solution has to print the secret that it receives
back from the server.
